# Traffic Sign Classification - Experimentation Process

## Network Architecture Experimentation

During the development of the traffic sign classification model, I experimented with various neural network architectures and hyperparameters to find an optimal balance between model performance and computational efficiency. Here's a detailed breakdown of my experimentation process:

### Initial Approach
I started with a simple architecture consisting of a single convolutional layer (32 filters) followed by max pooling and a dense layer. This baseline model achieved around 85% accuracy but showed signs of underfitting, suggesting the need for a more complex architecture to capture the nuanced features of traffic signs.

### Architecture Iterations
1. **Adding Convolutional Layers**:
   - First iteration: Added a second Conv2D layer (64 filters)
   - Second iteration: Added a third Conv2D layer (64 filters)
   - Each additional convolutional layer improved the model's ability to detect more complex features
   - The final three-layer architecture showed significant improvement in recognizing fine details in signs

2. **Layer Size Experimentation**:
   - Tested different filter sizes: 16, 32, 64, and 128
   - Found that increasing from 32 to 64 filters in later layers provided better feature detection
   - Further increasing to 128 filters didn't yield significant improvements but increased training time

3. **Dropout Implementation**:
   - Initially ran without dropout and noticed overfitting (high training accuracy but lower test accuracy)
   - Experimented with dropout rates: 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5
   - Settled on 0.5 dropout after the dense layer, which provided the best regularization effect

### What Worked Well
- The three-layer convolutional architecture with increasing filter sizes (32 -> 64 -> 64)
- Max pooling after each convolutional layer helped reduce spatial dimensions while maintaining important features
- Dropout of 0.5 effectively prevented overfitting
- ReLU activation functions provided good non-linearity without the vanishing gradient problem
- Adam optimizer with default learning rate showed stable convergence

### What Didn't Work Well
- Deeper networks (4+ convolutional layers) showed diminishing returns and increased training time
- Smaller filter sizes (16) in initial layers resulted in poor feature detection
- Higher dropout rates (>0.5) led to underfitting
- Batch normalization didn't significantly improve performance for this particular dataset
- Larger dense layers (256, 512 units) increased complexity without proportional accuracy gains

### Key Observations
1. The German Traffic Sign dataset benefits more from multiple convolutional layers than from wider layers
2. Image preprocessing (resizing to 30x30) provided a good balance between detail preservation and computational efficiency
3. The model showed better performance on signs with distinct shapes (like stop signs) compared to number-based signs (speed limits)
4. Data augmentation wasn't necessary given the size and variety of the GTSRB dataset

The final architecture achieves approximately 95% accuracy on the test set, which is a good balance between model complexity and performance. Further improvements might be possible with techniques like ensemble learning or more sophisticated architectures, but the current model provides reliable classification while maintaining reasonable training times and computational requirements.
